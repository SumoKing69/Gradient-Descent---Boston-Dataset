# Gradient-Descent---Boston-Dataset

The Boston Price Prediction project uses Gradient Descent to predict the future prices of houses located in Boston. The model is trained by the data in the 
Train_dataset.csv and then it is tested against Test_dataset values. 
As we are training the model and then taking the predictions, it is a supervised learning model.

The predictions made by using 0.155 as the learning rate and 100 iterations is saved as Predictions.csv. 
The values change under different learning rates and iterations.
